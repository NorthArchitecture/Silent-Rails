# 🏛️ $NORTH | Silent Rails
**The Sovereign Standard for Institutional Privacy on Solana.**

### **The Innovation**
$NORTH replaces legacy Merkle Tree mixers with **Silent Rails**: a high-capacity privacy layer powered by an **O(1) PDA Registry** and **on-chain Groth16 zero-knowledge proof verification**. We deliver confidential deposits, transfers, and withdrawals at Solana speed, maintaining **sub-400ms finality** without overhead.

### **Core Pillars**
* **Isolated Tunnels:** Cryptographically sealed private rails. No shared pools, zero contamination risk.
* **ZK-Verified Privacy:** On-chain Groth16 proof verification over alt_bn128 curve. Every deposit, transfer, and withdrawal is mathematically proven.
* **Institutional Silence:** Un-traceable, sovereign-grade privacy designed for professional settlements.
* **Native Performance:** Native Solana speed with zero performance compromise.
* **Memory-Optimized Execution:** Critical instruction contexts use Boxed Accounts to reduce stack pressure and keep execution stable under BPF constraints.
* **Multi-Asset Isolation:** SOL and SPL flows are isolated through deterministic Asset State PDAs per rail and per asset.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lookup Complexity** | O(log n) (Slow) | **O(1) (Constant Time)** |

## ⚙️ Technical Core: Sentinel V2 Architecture

### Deployed Program
**Program ID:** `C2WJzwp5XysqRm5PQuM6ZTAeYxxhRyUWf3UJnZjVqMV5`  
**Network:** Devnet  
**Status:** ✅ Active (Deployed Feb 16, 2026)

### ZK Privacy Layer (Groth16 + Poseidon)
Sentinel V2 implements a complete zero-knowledge privacy stack:

* **3 ZK Circuits** (circom): `sentinel_commitment`, `sentinel_transfer`, `sentinel_withdraw`
* **On-chain Groth16 Verifier**: Native alt_bn128 pairing checks via Solana precompiles
* **Poseidon Hash Commitments**: `commitment = Poseidon(secret, amount)` — binding and hiding
* **ElGamal Encrypted Balances**: Homomorphic encryption for confidential balance tracking
* **Trusted Setup**: Powers of Tau ceremony (pot16) with phase 2 contributions per circuit

### Scoped Privacy Rails
Unlike traditional mixers, we decouple the **Privacy Validation** from the **Global State**:

* **O(1) Nullifier Registry:** Instant double-spend protection using deterministic seeds `[b"nullifier", rail, hash]`. No global state sniffing possible.
* **Handshake Isolation:** Each transaction is cryptographically scoped to its specific Institutional Rail, preventing cross-rail data leakage.
* **Audit Seal:** Programmable disclosure mechanism for institutional auditability (MiCA-ready) without public exposure.

### Program Instructions (15 total)
| Category | Instructions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rail Management** | `initialize_rail`, `seal_rail`, `deactivate_rail`, `pause_rail`, `unpause_rail` |
| **ZK Vault** | `initialize_zk_vault`, `get_balance` |
| **Handshakes** | `create_handshake`, `revoke_handshake` |
| **SOL Privacy** | `deposit`, `confidential_transfer`, `withdraw` |
| **Token Privacy** | `deposit_token`, `confidential_transfer_token`, `withdraw_token` |

### 🛡️ Security & Identity (Advanced PDA Architecture)
Sentinel Core is built on a **Deterministic State Machine** using Solana's **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)** to enforce strict security boundaries:
* **Groth16 Proof Verification**: Every deposit, transfer, and withdrawal requires a valid 256-byte ZK proof verified on-chain via alt_bn128 pairing.
* **Anti-Replay Protection**: Every transaction is bound to a unique Nullifier PDA, making replay attacks or double-spending computationally impossible.
* **Nonce-Based Transfer Hardening**: Confidential transfer records are derived with nonce-bound PDA seeds to block replay across transfer paths.
* **Commitment Verification**: On-chain balance commitments are checked against provided values before any state transition.
* **Institutional Governance**: Supports `Pause` and `Deactivate` states, allowing authorities to freeze rails for maintenance or regulatory reasons.
* **Authority Lockdown**: Using Anchor constraints (`has_one`, deterministic `seeds`, receiver authority checks), only valid PDA-linked authorities can mutate sensitive state.
* **Immutable Audit Trail**: Once a rail is `is_sealed`, its state becomes immutable, providing a "frozen" timeline for Big4-grade audits.
